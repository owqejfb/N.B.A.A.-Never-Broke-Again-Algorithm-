# N.B.A.A.-Never-Broke-Again-Algorithm-
NN built w/ Tensorflow that aims to predict NBA games for the purpose of sports betting. (Work In Progress, tips and recommendations welcome.)

Data is pulled from https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/

To do

-add the file that pulls seasonal data (makes a csv file of a whole season and then stacks them together.)

-current success rate is 70% but that is by testing any random 2018-2019 game. I could possibly improve success rate by retraining model after every 2018-19 with a weight bias against the respectice teams. (team strength changes more season per season than overall trends in the NBA that may affect team win rates)
